        <p class="about">
          I am a tier 3 college student from Asansol, WB, India, a striving
          learner and working hard with over 1.5+years of experience in web
          development. I am a <span>self-taught developer</span>, with a passion
          for learning and interested in bleeding-edge technologies and tech
          stack. During the phase of lockdown, I fell in love with programming
          and I have dipped my hands in some techs and learnt them thoroughly, I
          thinkâ€¦ I am fluent in classics like <span>C</span>, <span>Java</span>,
          and <span>Javascript</span> and also I enjoy doing web development,
          especially on the frontend side. Recently I have dived into the world
          of backend development and finally was able to break into the
          <span>MERN stack</span>. Fueled by high energy levels and boundless
          enthusiasm, I'm inspired and more willing to work on myself to learn
          and grow more as though there isn't any accurate age for learning. I
          am never satisfied to come up with ideas. Instead, I have an urge and
          need to act on them.
