    <span class="bio">
      I am a tier 3 college student from Asansol, WB, India, a striving learner
      and working hard with over 1.5+years of experience in web development. I
      am a <span>self-taught developer</span>, with a passion for learning and
      interested in bleeding-edge technologies and tech stack.<br>&emsp;&emsp;During
      the phase of lockdown, I fell in love with programming and I have dipped
      my hands in some techs and learnt them thoroughly, I thinkâ€¦ I am fluent in
      classics like <span>C</span>, <span>Java</span>, and
      <span>Javascript</span> and also I enjoy doing web development, especially
      on the frontend side. Recently I have dived into the world of backend
      development and finally was able to break into the
      <span>MERN stack</span>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Fueled by high energy levels and
      boundless enthusiasm, I'm inspired and more willing to work on myself to
      learn and grow more as though there isn't any accurate age for learning. I
      am never satisfied to come up with ideas. Instead, I have an urge and need
      to act on them.
